      "text": "The Serpent Hills region is a windswept badland of dry hills, rocky gullies, and scattered marshes along the Winding Water. It gets its name from the plentiful serpents that slither through its ravines. The area hosts an unusually large snake population \u2013 everything from small venomous vipers up to giant constrictors thrives here. Travelers must watch every step; a stick on the ground might actually be a snake (hence the local saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not a stick\u201d, which became the title of one famous explorer\u2019s journal). In addition to snakes, other reptiles abound: lizards of all sizes bask on the warm rocks, and one can even find amphibians like giant toads in the damp sinkholes. The hills themselves are fairly barren of large vegetation, but scraggly shrubs and thorny cacti grow in the valleys. These support populations of rodents and insects, which in turn feed the smaller snakes. In the few fertile pockets (like near Serpent\u2019s Cowl or the Serpent\u2019s Tail Stream), one finds more life \u2013 deer and wild boar come to drink, shadowed by predators."

      "text": "Serpents rule the food chain here. Giant snakes hunt through the ravines, including monstrous constrictors that can crush a mule, and giant venomous serpents whose bite can fell an orc. One legendary creature is the \u201cGiant Snake\u201d of the hills \u2013 said to be a 30-foot serpent with a petrifying gaze like a basilisk. Though eyewitness accounts are few, enough people swear to have seen it that scholars felt compelled to include it in bestiaries. If it exists, it might be some unique basilisk-kin or a magical mutation. Apart from snakes, other reptilian monsters lurk: basilisks (stone-gazing lizards) and cockatrices are rumored in certain caves. In the waterlogged areas, giant crocodiles and hydra-headed water snakes have been reported. The Marsh of Chelimber, on the western fringe, even holds a few black dragons that prefer the swamps just adjacent to the Hills. Those dragons sometimes venture into the Serpent Hills to hunt or to clash with rivals. In fact, multiple dragon species have laired around these hills: sages note sightings of black, brass, bronze, copper, and red dragons in the wider region. Each stakes out a particular territory \u2013 for example, an ancient brass dragon reportedly holds court in the dunes south of the hills, while a sinister young red dragon occasionally terrorizes caravans near Boareskyr Bridge. These dragons typically keep each other in check, but any one of them is a deadly threat to travelers."

      "title": "Lizardfolk & Intelligent Denizens",
      "text": "In the wet lowlands between the hills, tribes of lizardfolk have established villages. These reptilian humanoids of the Serpent Swamp (as they call the local marsh) are surprisingly organized. They have a crude culture with government, commerce, and entertainments of their own. Their chieftains (sometimes called Lizard Kings) rule from semi-submerged halls in the marsh. One such lair, dubbed \u201cIn the Hall of the Lizard King\u201d, was documented by an adventurer and described as a large mound filled with tunnels and chambers for the tribe. The lizardfolk here are generally hostile to outsiders (whom they see as either enemies or potential trade goods in the form of meat). They do sometimes trade with yuan-ti or other serpent-folk, exchanging swamp herbs and captured treasure for weapons. A particularly intriguing note: the lizardfolk have a legend of an ancient reptilian empire and often speak of \u201cThe Snake People\u201d who will one day reclaim these lands. This hints at the presence of far more dangerous intelligences in the Serpent Hills.\n\nIndeed, the hills hide pockets of Yuan-ti \u2013 the snake people of legend. These sinister beings (part-human, part-serpent) dwell in ruined complexes from a bygone age. At least one hidden temple of the yuan-ti lies beneath the hills, where these \u201csnake folk\u201d (including degenerate ophidians and powerful spirit naga sorcerers) conduct dark rituals. The yuan-ti operate from the shadows, sending their agents (disguised or in snake form) to manipulate events. Travelers might never see them, but their influence is felt; for example, unexplained disappearances or mysteriously poisoned wells near Boareskyr Bridge are often attributed to yuan-ti scheming. According to one account, a band of adventurers discovered a yuan-ti plot to unite all the region\u2019s serpents under their control. While that plot was foiled, the yuan-ti remain a continual menace, treating all other creatures as either slaves or food. In addition to yuan-ti, the hills are home to solitary nagas \u2013 enormous serpents with human-like intelligence. Dark nagas slither through ancient tombs, and at least one guardian water naga resides in the Serpent\u2019s Tail Stream. These naga sometimes ally with the yuan-ti, though often reluctantly. Ophidians, which are cursed snake-human hybrids, also prowl the area; they are less intelligent, used as foot soldiers by yuan-ti leaders."

      "title": "Other Hazards",
      "text": "The Serpent Hills contain scattered ruins \u2013 remnants of long-lost civilizations (possibly ancient sarrukh or yuan-ti cities). Within these ruins, constructs and animants left by the old inhabitants still guard the secrets. Explorers have reported animated stone guardians, such as stone golems or gargoyles, suddenly attacking intruders in vine-choked temples. Undead also linger in certain cursed sites. For example, Lyran\u2019s Hold, an old abandoned keep in the Forest of Wyrms nearby, is haunted by ghouls and specters and occasionally they drift into the edges of the Serpent Hills. On the positive side, dragons in the region sometimes check the population of monsters \u2013 a hungry dragon will as gladly eat a clutch of giant snakes or a nest of nagas as it will a lost merchant caravan. The volatile mix of dragons, yuan-ti, lizardfolk, and roaming monsters actually prevents any one threat from completely overrunning the Serpent Hills. Locals say that \u201ceven the snakes have predators here.\u201d"

      "text": "Many tales surround the Serpent Hills. One persistent rumor speaks of a great \u201cPit of Death\u201d where a cult of Sseth (the snake-god) attempted a summoning \u2013 only to all die mysteriously. Treasure is said to lie with their bones, but those who seek it never return. Another story is that of Lashan the Wyrm, a fabled giant snake that supposedly swims through the earth as easily as water. Some claim this creature is responsible for sudden sinkholes and the collapse of an old yuan-ti dungeon in recent years. Within the Marsh of Chelimber, locals speak of \u201cghost lights\u201d \u2013 likely will-o\u2019-wisps \u2013 that lure travelers into quicksand. Finally, it\u2019s whispered that the yuan-ti leaders are uniting disparate serpent cults across Faer\u00fbn. The \u201cYuan-ti Plot\u201d uncovered recently hints at a wider network, though skeptics doubt snake-people could organize on such a scale. What is certain is that The Serpent Hills remain one of the most dangerous and fascinating ecological regions, where the line between animal and monster, natural and unnatural, is constantly blurred."
