      "text": "Thar is widely known for its savage humanoid tribes \u2013 orcs, ogres, trolls, gnolls, and goblinoids \u2013 which roam its gray-green steppes in constant competition. These tribes serve as both predators and prey in Thar\u2019s ecosystem. Orcs are perhaps the most numerous, but they are fragmented into many warbands that skirmish endlessly. They hunt the herds of wild rothe (musk oxen) and antelope that graze the tough grasses, and they also prey on each other. It\u2019s often said that \u201cone bulette is more than enough for anyone to deal with; a tribe of orcs, however, might not be the worst thing you can encounter\u201d, as a seasoned ranger of Thar wryly note\u3011. Indeed, while a band of a hundred orcs is fearsome, the vast steppeland can throw even deadlier single monsters at a traveler (more on those below). The ogres of Thar historically dominated the orcs \u2013 this was once an ogre kingdom \u2013 and ogre clans still bully orc tribes for food and territory. Hobgoblins occupy the higher ground and often raid the orcs as well, while gnolls and trolls skulk in the marshy eastern reaches, ambushing stragglers. This constant inter-humanoid predation curtails any one group from overpopulating. For example, if the orcs breed too quickly and overhunt the rothe, soon a stronger ogre warlord or a marauding monster will decimate the starving orcs, letting the rothe herds recover. In this brutal way, a rough balance is maintained. The humanoids also act as scavengers \u2013 few carcasses go to waste on the Tharian plains, as goblins or kobolds will eagerly strip a kill down to bones. (Half the time, they themselves then become a snack for a prowling manticore or Thar\u2019s legendary vultures.)"

      "title": "\u201cGreat Beasts\u201d and Apex Predators",
      "text": "Thar\u2019s open expanse is home to a frightening array of large monsters that fill the top of the food chain whenever the humanoids aren\u2019t on top. Manticores are a prime example \u2013 these winged lion-like monstrosities thrive in Thar\u2019s solitude. In recent years their numbers have \u201csteadily increased, especially in wilderness regions such as the Gray Land of Thar,\u201d with at least three breeding pairs known to lair across the plain\u3011. Manticores hunt anything they can: they prefer human(oid) flesh, but will settle for giant prairie oxen or even hobgoblins when human prey is scarc\u3011. They often hurl tail spikes from high above to weaken a target, then swoop down. Only the largest creatures (like giants or dragons) deter them. Another apex predator here is the bulette, or landshark \u2013 an armored, tunneling monstrosity. Bulettes prowl Thar\u2019s moors and tundra, sensing vibrations of passing herds or marching orcs and erupting from the ground beneath them. As one traveler shouted during an ambush, \u201cIt\u2019s a bulette! A landshark!\u201d, after which two knights were dragged to their deaths beneath the eart\u3011. Even the orcs fear bulettes, often moving camp if \u201ctremors\u201d are felt. Chimerae (three-headed chimera monsters) and gorgons (iron-scaled bulls with petrifying breath) also appear in Tha\u3011. These \u201cgreat beasts\u201d are less common but make up for it in power. A hungry chimera might devastate an entire gnoll pack in a night. Gorgons sometimes clash with manticores over carcasses (the gorgon\u2019s hide is so tough that manticore spikes bounce off it).\n\nThere are also rare magical beasts: rumors persist of a medusa dwelling in an old ruin on Thar\u2019s western edge, her gaze adding new stone statues to the forlorn landscape. Adventurers have indeed found oddly lifelike stone figures of ogres and horses, lending credence to the medusa legend. Thar\u2019s vastness even hosts monstrosities from elsewhere \u2013 \u201csuch creatures as bulettes and chimerae turn up in surprising numbers. We have far more than our share of oddities, many of them refugees from Myth Drannor,\u201d notes one accoun\u3011. (Some sages think that after Myth Drannor\u2019s fall, certain monsters migrated north and found Thar to their liking.) The net effect is that no single creature can dominate Thar for long: a rampaging chimera might terrorize the plains for a season, only to stray into the territory of a manticore pride or a company of well-armed ogres and be slain. Likewise, if one predator dwindles, another rises to fill the gap (for instance, when a concerted effort by adventurers slew several manticores, reports show gryphons from the Dragonspine Mountains began hunting in Thar more frequently until the manticores recovere\u3011)."

      "text": "The common wildlife of Thar is sparse but hardy. Wild rothe (shaggy cattle) graze in small herds, digging through snow for lichen in winter. Fleet-footed antelopes and wild donkeys wander between watering holes. These herbivores support packs of steppe wolves which, in turn, often end up as meals for bigger predators or get tamed by hobgoblins for war. In boggy areas, colonies of giant frogs and toads thrive, feeding on the prolific insects that breed in stagnant pools. It\u2019s noted that normal animals in Thar often grow to unusual size or ferocity, perhaps due to magical contamination or simply the need to survive amidst monsters. Stories speak of pony-sized boars with temperaments to match any orc. Plant life is mostly tough grass, sedge, and thorny scrub. However, certain magical herbs unique to Thar (like Thar\u2019s Gray Moss) are sought by alchemists for their use in hardy endurance potions \u2013 a result of evolution in such an unforgiving clime."

      "text": "Thar\u2019s bloody history (from endless tribal wars and failed invasions) means the soil is literally littered with bones. In some locales, ghosts and spectral warriors haunt old battlefields, especially on nights of the full moon. These undead usually keep to reenacting their ancient battles and seldom bother living creatures unless provoked. Still, travelers sometimes hear the midnight clash of phantom arms on the open plain. One persistent legend is that of the \u201cWailing Tower\u201d \u2013 the ruin of an old ogre magi\u2019s stronghold where an entire legion of ogres was annihilated by an enemy\u2019s curse. Locals claim on certain nights a chorus of ogre voices keens on the wind near the ruin, and those who approach may be set upon by spectral ogre zombies bound to the site. Another tale, possibly fanciful, is of a dracolich (undead dragon) that lairs beneath Thar\u2019s eastern bogs. While no direct evidence exists, Thar does have an infamous association with dragons: manticores and other beasts sometimes speak of \u201cThar\u2019s King\u201d in fearful tones, hinting that an ancient dragon or similar tyrant might periodically awaken or arrive to terrorize the region. Historically, dragons have not found Thar hospitable long-term (too few rich food sources), but adventurers occasionally find signs \u2013 like a charred ogre encampment or huge scales in the mud \u2013 that suggest a red dragon passed through or briefly established a lair. Fortunately, such dragons tend to move on toward more bountiful territories around the Moonsea."

      "title": "Chaotic Balance",
      "text": "The ecology of Thar is one of continuous upheaval, but also harsh equilibrium. As a cynical Tharian ranger put it, **\u201cthe average \u2018sensible\u2019 inhabitant of Faer\u00fbn is a seedy bumpkin\u2026 I\u2019ve never put much stock in their pronouncements to avoid Thar. When they all flee, I immediately made plans to go there.\u201d*\u3011. This ranger, Talyssa, discovered that while Thar seemed barren and deadly, it also meant no one dominant species rules it for long \u2013 providing opportunities for a cunning survivor. For instance, after a particularly savage winter (where a \u201cweek-of-no-sun\u201d storm froze many creatures solid), she observed that come spring, new grass sprouted thick on the corpses, drawing herbivores from elsewhere which in turn revitalized predator numbers. In Thar, boom-and-bust cycles of life are the norm. A great horde or monster can scour the land of life (a \u201cbust\u201d), but inevitably that dominant force dwindles or departs, and the remnants of life creep back (the \u201cboom\u201d). The endless winds then cover the old bones with fresh soil, literally and figuratively giving new life a foothold. Thus Thar, for all its reputation as a \u201cGreat Gray Wasteland,\u201d is very much alive \u2013 if in a cruel, ever-changing way. Adventurers venturing here must be prepared for extremes: you might see \u201ca tribe of orcs\u2026 not the worst thing,\u201d or you might face a rampaging bulette or manticore pride the very next da\u3011. The only constant is Thar\u2019s unpredictability. To survive, one must adapt as fluidly as the land\u2019s inhabitants do. As Talyssa quips, \u201cMaybe one day nature will shrug off all these troublemakers \u2013 or maybe not. In the meantime, it\u2019s home for me.\u201d She has learned what any creature in Thar knows: strength, savagery, and cunning are the keys to eke out an existence in the Great Gray Land, where only the hardiest (or luckiest) live to see another daw\u3011."
