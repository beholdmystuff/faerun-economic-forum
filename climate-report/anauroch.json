      "text": "Anauroch is the vast desert that dominates north-central Faer\u00fbn \u2013 \u201cdry, desolate, and deadly\u201d, in the words of one explorer. It spans several ecological sub-regions: the Sword (the sandy central desert), the Plain of Standing Stones (a steppeland littered with petrified monoliths), the High Ice (a frozen glacier in the far north), and even an Underdark region beneath its sands. Despite its inhospitable nature, life finds a way in every part of Anauroch. The open dunes of the Sword seem empty at first glance, but hardy creatures and nomadic peoples eke out an existence. The stony plains at the desert\u2019s edges support tough scrub plants and burrowing animals. The High Ice is an arctic ecosystem of its own, where furred beasts and frost monsters roam the icy waste. And unknown to most, a labyrinth of caverns below the desert hosts subterranean species. Each of these sub-regions has distinct inhabitants and challenges."

      "title": "The Sword (Central Desert) \u2013 Dune Ecology",
      "text": "The Sword is the heart of Anauroch \u2013 a sea of rolling dunes, scorching by day and frigid by night. Vegetation is scarce; only thorny shrubs and the occasional cactus grow around rare oases. Yet animals and monsters adapted to desert life thrive here. One common sight is the scorpion \u2013 from tiny sand scorpions to gigantic Emperor scorpions the size of hounds. They lie hidden under the sand, ambushing prey (and serving as prized food for certain desert predators like dragons). Serpents also slither through the Sword\u2019s dunes, including the deadly amphisbaena, a two-headed snake. Scholars note the life cycle of the amphisbaena as peculiar: it is said to hunt in packs and lay eggs in the carcasses of its victims. Rodents such as sand mice and jerboas survive on whatever seeds they can find, providing a food source for larger creatures. In turn, desert foxes and jackals prey on those small animals during the cool dawn and dusk hours.\n\nAt the top of the food chain in the Sword are fearsome monsters. Blue dragons are the undisputed masters of Anauroch\u2019s skies. These enormous sapphire-scaled dragons soar above the dunes and can spot a lone traveler from miles away. They delight in using their lightning breath on unsuspecting camel caravans. Folk tales in surrounding lands speak of sudden storms on a clear day \u2013 the only warning of a blue dragon\u2019s approach. Fortunately, only a few blues reside in the desert at any time, each claiming a huge territory. Far less benevolent than blue dragons are the unique desert variants of dragon known to inhabit Anauroch. Travelers occasionally report sightings of brown dragons and yellow dragons \u2013 lesser draconic breeds adapted to sand. These are smaller than true chromatic dragons but still formidable. They burrow through the dunes and ambush prey much like a landshark. Their presence is speculative, but encounter tables from the area include entries for \u201cOther dragon\u201d with types like brown or yellow, lending credence to these rumors. More confirmed is the presence of dragonnes \u2013 dragon-like beasts with lion-like bodies. A few dragonnes prowl the southern Sword, using their stunning roars and powerful jaws to bring down antelope or unwary humans.\n\nOne of the desert\u2019s most dreaded predators is the Anauroch manticore. These manticores have adapted slightly differently from those found elsewhere. The Bedine (Anauroch\u2019s nomads) call them gared-guur. They often hunt in packs of three to twelve individuals, cooperating to take down large prey. Manticores here are known to roost near the high places where giant eagles nest, as they favor giant eagle meat when they can get it. They\u2019ve even developed tactics to battle the big birds in aerial combat \u2013 one witness described how they use tail spikes to force a diving eagle to break off its attack. While elsewhere manticores prefer human flesh, in the deep desert humans are rare, so the manticores content themselves with rocs, hobgoblins (when they venture into the waste), and any other meat available. Their numbers in Anauroch have \u201csteadily increased, especially in wilderness regions such as the Gray Land of Thar\u201d, and likewise in the Sword. Travelers should consider a large pride of manticores as dangerous as a dragon. Another peculiarity of the Sword are the desert trolls. Unlike common trolls of swamps, these desert trolls have adapted to the arid climate. They are scrawnier and their regenerative powers are weaker without moisture \u2013 in fact, \u201cany contact with water causes a desert troll damage\u201d (the opposite of normal trolls)! They have evolved a vulnerability to water as a trade-off for tolerating extreme heat. This means they rarely approach the few oases (where humans often camp), ironically making them less encountered by travelers than one would expect. Still, when a desert troll pack does find prey, they are ferocious, attacking with claws and teeth like their wetland kin."

      "title": "Nomads and Intelligent Races",
      "text": "The Bedine, the nomadic humans of Anauroch, are the primary intelligent inhabitants of the Sword. \u201cAlmost without exception, the tribes remain in [the Sword].\u201d They traverse from well to well, **\u201cwater\u2026 more precious than diamonds\u201d\u3011. They travel by night to avoid the blistering daytime heat. The Bedine survive by herding goats, hunting small game, and trading. They tell stories of desert spirits and are keenly aware of the creatures around them. Bedine scouts have a vast knowledge of desert signs \u2013 for instance, they can identify a bulette (landshark) burrow from subtle sand ridges and will detour miles to avoid it, knowing that **\u201cone bulette is more than enough for anyone to deal with\u201d\u3011. Indeed, bulettes roam parts of Anauroch. A caravan guard once shouted \u201cIt\u2019s a bulette! A landshark!\u201d as one erupted from beneath the dunes to attack; the creature proceeded to kill multiple knights before it was driven off. These bulettes consider anything that moves as prey, from camels to giant scorpions. The Bedine also must contend with gnoll warbands on the fringes \u2013 hyena-headed humanoids that sometimes venture into the desert from bordering lands (usually in the spring, before retreating when water grows scarce). Rare centaur nomads (perhaps from the Plain of Standing Stones) have been sighted at the desert\u2019s edge as well, though they do not enter the true dunes."

      "title": "The Plain of Standing Stones (Steppe Zone)",
      "text": "Along the northern and eastern border of the Sword lies the Plain of Standing Stones \u2013 a semi-arid steppe marked by strange stone spires and ancient ruins. This zone is slightly more hospitable: patches of tough grass and thorn bushes grow here, supporting herds of spotted lions (cheetah-like big cats) and wild donkeys. The Bedine sometimes graze their horses here during favorable seasons. Notably, perytons have been a menace in this region. These evil creatures (with the body of a giant eagle and head of a stag) prey on humanoids and are a \u201cconstant danger to goblins and other races in the Stonelands and southern Goblin Marches\u201d, and likewise on the Plain of Standing Stones just south of those areas. Perytons prefer human hearts, but in lean times will snatch orcs or elves. They swoop silently from the sky to surprise victims, and mundane weapons bounce off their enchanted hides. Bedine accounts say perytons have the shadow of a man, leading wise shaykhs to suspect they were once human and were cursed. These monsters are cunning and patient, \u201clike a cat at a mouse hole,\u201d waiting hours in ambush without moving. In one harrowing tale, a band of perytons attacked a Bedine camp repeatedly at dusk each day, picking off a few people at a time, until finally brave warriors lured them with livestock and managed to kill two with blessed spears (magic weapons) \u2013 only then did the rest desist. Clearly, perytons pose a dire threat wherever they lair. Aside from perytons, the Plain of Standing Stones hosts behirs \u2013 enormous blue-white serpents with many legs that can unleash lightning. A behir often claims a region of the rocky plain, eating wild goats and the occasional unwary traveler. Chimerae have also been reported here, likely having wandered from the Stonelands or escaped magical experiments. These three-headed monsters (part lion, goat, and dragon) are extremely dangerous apex predators. Combined with roaming gnoll packs and some medusae rumored to lurk in crumbling ruins, it\u2019s clear the Standing Stones area is far from safe. However, it does have more waterholes and life than the deep desert, so it serves as a transitional ecosystem. Many creatures (like antelopes, rabbits, smaller snakes) live here and nowhere in the dunes."

      "title": "One curious inhabitant of the steppes is the enkidu (also known as the \u201cstone guardian\u201d)",
      "text": "a creature resembling animated standing stones that moves only when not watched. Some explorers believe the Standing Stones themselves may shuffle positions over time, explaining why maps of the area often become inaccurate. These could be a form of native elemental life or ancient golems. Kobold clans have been seen worshiping particularly large obelisks, possibly indicating some draconic magic at work (since kobolds serve dragons)."

      "title": "The High Ice (Northern Anauroch) \u2013 Frozen Wastes",
      "text": "The High Ice is a high-altitude glacier covering the northern reach of Anauroch \u2013 a frigid expanse of ice and windswept snowfields. It is as hostile as any arctic tundra. Still, certain hardy (or magical) creatures live here. Remorhaz, the dreaded polar worms, are among the most feared. These \u201chuge worms\u201d burrow under the ice and snow, sensing heat and vibration. When prey is near, a remorhaz erupts from below with its maw gaping. One explorer recounts how a small remorhaz swallowed a companion whole in a sudden attack. Remorhaz generate intense internal heat \u2013 hot enough that weapons can melt or catch fire when striking them. On the High Ice, the remorhaz is \u201cprobably among the most feared creatures\u201d, even earning the awe of other monsters. In fact, the High Ice is ruled by a mighty white dragon named Augaurath. This ancient female white dragon has laired in the glacier for ages and is \u201cundisputed\u201d in dominance there. Remarkably, it is said that intelligent remorhaz worship her as a god. Whether the normally brute-minded remorhaz have truly become intelligent or this refers to a related species of ice worm with human-like cunning is unclear \u2013 but given that some remorhaz have lived for centuries, perhaps a few have developed sentience. Either way, Augaurath exerts a level of control over the High Ice\u2019s ecosystem: she periodically culls the remorhaz (to keep their numbers manageable) and in turn may tolerate them as acolytes or guard beasts. Aside from remorhaz, yeti stalk the High Ice. These white-furred ape-like humanoids are \u201cintelligent and crafty, cunningly burying themselves in snowbanks to ambush prey\u201d. Despite their stealth and brute strength, yeti themselves must fear the remorhaz \u2013 the worms can sense even a hidden yeti and will burst up to devour it. Yeti typically hunt caribou or polar bears, but they have been known to attack human expeditions, especially if provoked by hunger or trespass. White puddings (an arctic variant of the deadly gelatinous cube) ooze through ice caverns, dissolving anything organic; one Bedine story tells of a warrior who fled onto the glacier from pursuers only to be absorbed by a seemingly innocent snowdrift that was alive. The tundra parts of the High Ice (where some moss and lichen grow) support small herds of musk oxen and hardy snow hares, which in turn feed arctic foxes and winter wolves (white-furred, intelligent dire wolves that breathe frost). These more mundane creatures cluster on the edges of the glacier, away from the truly fearsome monsters at its heart."

      "title": "Elemental Curiosities",
      "text": "The High Ice has a unique species called Ice Toads. These are man-sized toads adapted to subzero temperatures. They have a rudimentary intelligence and form colonies around geothermal vents in the ice. A Bedine guide wrote: \u201cNo Bedine should ever be forced to endure the savage cold of the High Ice\u201d, remarking on how alien the environment is. The ice toads survive by feeding on insects and small fish in subglacial lakes, and notably they prey on the eggs of white dragons (should they find any), which makes Augaurath hostile to them. Another quirk involves fire toads: in a strange twist, a population of fire-breathing toads once lived at the glacier\u2019s edge, feeding on umber hulk larvae that periodically migrated there. When umber hulks ate all the larvae, the fire toads had to adapt to eating beetles, showing even elemental creatures adapt in this extreme ecosystem. The weather of the High Ice \u2013 constant blizzards, whiteouts, and howling winds \u2013 itself shapes behavior. Creatures here have learned to use storms as cover. Yeti will move during blizzards knowing humans hunker down. Remorhaz actually become more active in storms, as prey is more likely to be caught unaware."

      "title": "Underdark of Anauroch",
      "text": "Beneath the sands and stones of Anauroch lies an extension of the great Underdark. Caverns and tunnels weave under the desert (some carved by ancient Netherese magic, some natural). These depths harbor secretive and dangerous beings. The famed explorer Ibn al\u2019Arif recounted being captured by creatures \u201cdwelling in the Underdark below Anauroch\u201d, from whom he eventually escaped. He refused to fully describe them, calling them \u201cdeadly beings\u201d and implying they were an evil so great he dared not record it plainly. Scholars suspect he fell into the hands of the phaerimm \u2013 terrible magical aberrations that were responsible for the desert\u2019s creation. Others guess perhaps mind flayers or derro enslaved him. Regardless, Ibn gained much knowledge from that ordeal and hinted that \u201cthere exists, in all likelihood, no one who knows as much about the desert\u2019s secrets\u201d as those creatures did. Documented denizens of Anauroch\u2019s Underdark include gray dwarves (duergar) in deep mines, grimlocks (blind subterranean humanoids) prowling near the Great Rift, and watchful neogi (spider-eel-like slavers) who sometimes creep up under the Plain of Standing Stones. The sarrukh \u2013 an ancient race of serpentfolk \u2013 are rumored to have a hidden city beneath the desert sands, possibly in the very center of the Sword, accessible only by magic. There are also subterranean oases where bioluminescent fungi allow strange ecosystems to flourish. In one such cavern, explorers found blind white fish in a spring and pale crayfish \u2013 an entire food chain cut off from the surface. Some desert creatures exploit the Underdark: antlions dig deep pit traps that break into underground tunnels, expanding their hunting ground. A most bizarre recent report suggests that a remorhaz somehow tunneled down and emerged far to the south, in the Calim Desert \u2013 essentially traveling through the Underdark and resurfacing. A sage wrote in disbelief about \u201cthe description of a remorhaz\u2026burrowing its way through the hot sands of the Sword! It may be a mutant or magically-created breed\u201d, implying perhaps an Underdark route allowed a remorhaz or similar monster to migrate. In summary, the Underdark adds a hidden layer to Anauroch\u2019s ecology. It provides occasional \u201cescape valves\u201d \u2013 for instance, an underground river might allow an oasis to exist on the surface, or Underdark monsters might emerge if drawn by surface activity."

      "title": "Human Presence & Adaptations",
      "text": "Humans (aside from the Bedine) seldom dwell long in Anauroch, but some unique adaptations have occurred when they do. The Bedine themselves have a rich oral tradition about desert creatures, detailing how each fits in the cycle. They note that even the mighty blue dragon is part of the chain: \u201cthe dragon eats the boar, the boar eats the snake, the snake eats the mouse\u201d. They have learned to use creatures in their survival \u2013 for example, Bedine hunters sometimes follow desert whistle lizards to water, knowing these small reptiles always burrow near moisture. Some Bedine tribes capture giant lizards and use them as pack animals or mounts in rocky terrain (giant lizards can carry loads and don\u2019t need as much water as camels). There is also talk of a \u201csandship\u201d culture \u2013 rumored descendants of Netherese who use magical skimmers to sail the dunes \u2013 but this is fringe rumor not confirmed by our sources. What is confirmed is the presence of a wise man known as Ibn al\u2019Arif, dubbed \u201cThe Son of the Great Lore\u201d, who has spent a lifetime cataloguing Anauroch\u2019s life. He shared survival tips such as how to find edible cacti and to track erzhu (a kind of desert hare) to find water. He emphasized \u201csurvival is in the details\u201d and that one must respect the desert\u2019s rhythms. It\u2019s said he guided an expedition to cross the entire desert by exploiting an underground cistern network and timing movements to seasonal creature migrations. Thanks to such knowledge, civilization has some foothold at the desert edges \u2013 caravans brave the Black Road around the northern fringe, and the Zhentarim have even established fortified stops (though these are often attacked by monsters or raiders)."

      "title": "Legends & Outlook",
      "text": "Anauroch holds many legends. The Bedine speak of the Lying Demon who impersonates an oasis to lure travelers to doom \u2013 likely a reference to mirages and perhaps a sand spirit (some think it\u2019s an efreeti trickster). They also tell of the Ghost Caravan: at certain full moons, the spectral image of a lost caravan of the ancient Netherese can be seen crossing the dunes, complete with ghostly camels and merchants, eternally searching for the pass they never found. Scholars have their own legends, primarily of Netherese ruins buried beneath the sands, containing magical artifacts and horrors in equal measure. Indeed, \u201crefugees from Myth Drannor\u201d \u2013 monsters unleashed by the fall of that distant city \u2013 are said to have fled to Anauroch and contributed to its dangers. One compelling rumor from the elves is that a rare species of couatl (winged serpent) nests in the hidden mountains of Anauroch, perhaps guarding something holy. As for the environment\u2019s trajectory, Anauroch is not static. The desert has been expanding and contracting over centuries. At one time, the southernmost sands were far north of their current extent. Climate shifts (possibly due to the phaerimm\u2019s magic or the return of the Shadovar) could one day make parts of Anauroch green again. Already, tales of the \u201cSemphar Miracle\u201d in the east \u2013 where a long-lost river resumed flow for a season \u2013 give hope that life may reclaim some of these wastes. Until then, Anauroch remains a mosaic of extreme ecologies: sun, sand, ice, and darkness, each with its own cast of creatures. Surviving here requires intimate knowledge of those creatures\u2019 habits and a healthy respect for the land\u2019s dangers. As Ibn al\u2019Arif\u2019s journals emphasize, \u201cevery environment, no matter how hostile to humankind, is compatible with some form of life\u201d, and Anauroch is the ultimate proof."
